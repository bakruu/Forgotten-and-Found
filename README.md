# Forgotten-and-Found
a Video Game for Global Game Jam 2021.


It's a video game about "Lost and Found" theme. My friend Serkan Celik and I decided to make an archeology game, but we had only 48 hours so we couldn't finished it properly. We wanted to share the files anyway, because the scripts for player movements and destroying blocks are pretty usefull. We wanted that the people from anywhere can download and use that data for their projects. Have fun everybody!
